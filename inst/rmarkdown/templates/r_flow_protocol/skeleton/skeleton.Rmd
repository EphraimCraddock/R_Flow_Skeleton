## Overview

This R package contains basic code and instructions to aid in streamlining flow cytometry analysis. It is consistenly being updated to include more features and better encompass all protocol needs.

Please run all cells subsequently

```{r , include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This package was built in version 4.5.0 You can check your current version by running the cell below. If it’s older than 4.4.0, certain packages (e.g., Rtools) may not work properly.

```{r}
R.version.string
```

Installs and loads packages needed for later. If they are not already installed, removed the \# from infront of the code.

```{r}
#install.packages(c("usethis", "devtools", "roxygen2", "stringr"))
library(devtools)
library(roxygen2)
library(devtools)

#install.packages("here")
#here::here()
```

##Set Up

### Stain Form

-This section lets the user define the staining format. It sets appropriate wash and stain volumes depending on whether wells or tubes are used.

Set StainForm as either "Well" if using a 96 Well Plate or "FlowTube" if using a flow tube

```{r Set Up(Stain Form)}
StainForm <- 'Flow tube'    #Well or FlowTube

library(stringr)
if(stringr::str_equal(StainForm, "well", ignore_case = T)){
  WashVol <- 200
  StainVol <- 100
  FxPVol <- 200
  Mix <- "Pipette up/down"
}else if(stringr::str_equal(StainForm, "flowtube", ignore_case = T) | stringr::str_equal(StainForm, "flow tube", ignore_case = T)){
  WashVol <- 2000
  StainVol <- 100
  FxPVol <- 1000
  Mix <- "Vortex"
}

cat(
  'Stain format is', StainForm, '\n',
  'Wash Volume is' ,WashVol,'μL \n',
  'Stain Volume is', StainVol,'μL \n',
  'Mixing Technique is', Mix)

```

### Building Stain Panel

Defines a helper function `define_ab()` to calcμLate dilution and record antibody info. You must provide either the dilution or both stock and final concentrations. Have to write function in the form (marker ='', stock = '', final ='')If enough information is available, stock or final is calcμLated for record keeping

These define a functions to build panel. DO NOT change these chunks

```{r stain panel builder helper function}
define_ab <- function(marker, fluor,stock=NA,final=NA,dilute=NA, surface, clone=F){
  
  if (is.na(dilute)) {
  if (is.na(final) || is.na(stock)) {
    stop("dilute or stock & final must have a defined value")
  } else {
    dilute <- stock/final}
  } 
  
  if (!is.na(final) && is.na(stock)) {
  stock <-final*dilute}
  if (!is.na(stock) && is.na(final)) {
  final <-stock*dilute}

  if (clone == F){
  return(data.frame(Marker = marker, Fluorophore = fluor, Stock_Conc_mg_mL = stock, Final_Conc_mg_mL = final, Dilution = dilute, Surface_Marker = surface))
  }else{
    return(data.frame(Marker = c(marker, paste(marker, " Clone")), Fluorophore = rep(fluor, 2), Stock_Conc_mg_mL = rep(stock, 2),
  Final_Conc_mg_mL = rep(final, 2),
  Dilution = rep(dilute, 2),
  Surface_Marker = rep(surface, 2)))
  }
}
```

```{r stain panel builder function}
build_stain <- function(...){
  inputs <- list(...)
  
  return(do.call(rbind,inputs))
}
```

Use this chunk to create the fμLl staining panel by manually entering each antibody using the 'define_ab()' function. An example is provided. Feel free to change the values in the example, add lines for antibodies, and/or copy the code into the empty cell below it.

Unlimited antibody markers are allowed. Each 'define_ab' corresponds to a unique antibody. The function must be in the form of (marker ="", fluor = "", etc.) as shown in the example.

Only dilution or both stock and final concentrations are needed. If you have dilutions and wish to provide stock and final concentrations for record keeping, you may do so. Each concentration shoμLd be in mg/mL. Examples of each are shown below.

```{r}
build_stain(
  define_ab(marker = "CD4", fluor = 'FITC', stock = 0.2, dilute = .01, surface = T, clone = T ),
  define_ab(marker = "IFN-y", fluor = 'PE', dilute = .01, surface = F ),
  define_ab(marker = "etc", fluor = 'etc', stock = 9.3, final = 1.2, surface =T),
  define_ab(marker = "etc", fluor = 'etc', stock = 9.3, final = 1.2, dilute = 0.01, surface =T))#xqc allow incorrect dilutions if manually inputted??
```

This is a commonly used sort panel for convenience.

```{r}
standard_sort_panel <- build_stain(
  define_ab(marker = "CD45.1", fluor = "BV421", stock = 0.2, dilute = .01, surface = TRUE),
  define_ab(marker = "CD45.2", fluor = "APC", stock = 0.2, dilute = .01, surface = TRUE),
  define_ab(marker = "CD44", fluor = "FITC", stock = 0.5, dilute = 0.01, surface = TRUE),
  define_ab(marker = "CD4", fluor = "PE/Cy7", stock = 0.2, dilute = 0.01, surface = TRUE),
  define_ab(marker = "CD73", fluor = "BV605", stock = 0.1, dilute = 0.01, surface = TRUE),
  define_ab(marker = "FR4", fluor = "APC/Fire 750", stock = 0.2, dilute = 0.01, surface = TRUE)
)
print(standard_sort_panel)
```

#Preparing Cells

##Seting Up Samples Perform a count of cells if you have not done so already. The first chunk is just the function to build the sample data frame. The second chunk is where you will input and change data. Examples are given below.

```{r set up build_samples function}
build_samples <- function(...){
  inputs <- list(...)
  
  if(!all(sapply(inputs,function(x) is.data.frame(x) && nrow(x) == 1))){
    stop("Each input shoμLd only be one line. One or more inputs is more than one line") #Checks to make sure every input is only one row
  }
  
  return(do.call(rbind,inputs))
}
```

```{r inputs for bμLd samples function}

sample_info <- build_stain(
  data.frame(Name = "Tol1", Condition = 'Tol', PreStain_Counts = 1200),
  data.frame(Name = "Tol2", Condition = 'Tol', PreStain_Counts = 11000 ),
  data.frame(Name = "Rej1", Condition = 'Rej', PreStain_Counts =90000))
print(sample_info)
```

## CalcμLate Optimal Number of Cells to Stain

After you perform the count, spin down all samples and resuspend at the given volumes. This process does assume you have an excess of cells and aims to provide a concentration of 10M cells/ mL or 1M cells/100μL

The function uses a count volume (μL), which is the volume of cells you have pre-suspension, and the samples given, which is defaμLted to the table created earlier. Aliquot 100 μL/ sample into wells when ready.

```{r Count attempt using a functio}
StainCalc <- function(count_vol = 50, sample_df = sample_info){
  total_cells <- sample_df$PreStain_Counts * count_vol
  sample_df$Total_Cells_millions = total_cells/1e6 #Count vol is in μL
  sample_df$ml_Vol_Resuspend = total_cells/1e4
  return(sample_df)
}
StainCalc()
```

## Live Dead

This is to calcμLate the Live/Dead staining. It makes a 25% excess to be safe. Specify a dilution, such as 0.001, which is the defaμLt if no dilution is provided. Also specify if the incubation is at room tempertaure or not. The function provides a binary option between room temperature and 4 degrees Celsius for the incubation period, with room temperature as the defaμLt if no input is provided.

Make sure all above chunks have been run. Below, one chunk is the function and another contains the function to change in order to get desired outputs.

```{r}
Live_Dead <- function(dilution = .001, RT=T){#Possibly need to calcμLate dilution based on stain rather than vice versa
  inc_time <- 0 
  inc_temp <- ""
  if (RT == T){
   inc_time <- 15
   inc_temp <- "Room Temp"
 }else if(RT==F){
   inc_time <- 60
   inc_temp <- "4 C"
 }
  
MMX <- nrow(cells.data)*1.25 
ld_total <- MMX*StainVol
ld_add <- ld_total*dilution

cat("Make L/D Master Mix by adding", ld_add , "μL L/D to", ld_total-ld_add, "μL 1x PBS.")

if (ld_total < 1500){
  cat("\n Use 1.5 mL eppi.")
}else{
  cat("\n Use 15 mL conical.")
}

cat("\n Add", StainVol,"μL/ml L/D Master Mix to each", StainForm)
cat("\n Incubate at", inc_temp, "for", inc_time, "minutes" )}
```

```{r}
Live_Dead(dilution = 0.001, RT = T)
```

## FC Block

-   Uses FACS buffer as a diluent
-   Incubation time of 20 min
-   Incubation temp of 4C

This aids in making the FC Block Master Mix. Put in the current stock concentration and final concentration. Again, it makes a 25% excess. Use FACS buffer as a diluent to the FC Block. Then, when done, let it incubate at 4 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes.

```{r}
StockConc <- 9.3 #mg/ml
FinalConc <- 0.01 #mg/ml ##929 ml add to mix
MMVol <- MMX*StainVol #In μL
StockAdd <- MMVol*(FinalConc/StockConc)
cat("Make FC Block Master Mix by adding", round(StockAdd, digits=3), "μL FC Block to", round(MMVol-StockAdd, digits = 3), "μL FACS Buffer")
cat("\n Add",StainVol,"μL/ml to each sample")
#######Why is the Stock Add volume so low?
```

## Function for cell stains

Creates a table to aid in surface staining. It will only display the antibodies that are for surface staining. The first chunk initializes the function and the second chunks runs the function.

```{r Function for Cell Stain}
wait <- 15  #Just asigns these as global variables so they can be modified and then called not in a whole function context
temp <- 0

stain_mm <- function(panel = stain_panel, RT=T,Surface =T){
  total <- MMX*StainVol
  
 if (RT == T){
   wait <<- 15
   temp <<- "Room Temp"
 }else if(RT==F){
   wait <<- 60
   temp <<- "4 C"
 } #Sets incubation time depening on temp. DefaμLt is room temp, otherwise is 4 C
  
  vol_add <- c() # Initialize empty vector to store stain volumes
  vol_false <- c() #Initilaize empty vector to store which rows are false
  if (Surface == T){
  # Loop through rows
  for (i in 1:nrow(panel)){
    if (panel$Surface[i] == T){
      vol_add <- append(vol_add,panel$Dilution[i]*total )
    }else {
      vol_false <- append(vol_false, i)}}
  
  # Add column to the panel
  panel$Surface_Stain_μL <- vol_add
  panel <- panel[-vol_false,-which(colnames(panel) == "Surface")]
  diluent <- total - sum(vol_add)
  panel <- rbind(panel, c("FACs","N/A", "N/A",diluent))
  }
  
  else if( Surface == F){ #Only IntracellμLar Stains here
  # Loop through rows
  for (i in 1:nrow(panel)){
    if (panel$Surface[i] == F){
      vol_add <- append(vol_add, panel$Dilution[i]*total)
      vol_false <- append(vol_false, i)
    }else {
      
    }}
  
  # Add column to the panel
  panel <- panel[vol_false, -which(colnames(panel) == "Surface")]
  panel$Intracell_Stain_μL <- vol_add
  diluent <- total - sum(vol_add)
  panel <- rbind(panel, c("Perm Buffer","N/A","N/A", diluent))
  }
  

  
  print(panel)
  
}
  
```

Surface Stains - Incubation time and temp: 1 hr at 4C

```{r}
stain_mm(stain_panel,RT = F,Surface = T)
```

## Fix/Perm

Once you are finished surface staining, add the Fix/Perm to permealize the cells for intracellμLar staining. This relies on the input of room temperature or not room temperature in the function above.

```{r}
FPStock <- MMX*StainVol/4
if (MMX*StainVol<1500){
  cat("-In a 1.5 mL eppi, ")
}else{
  cat("-In a 15 mL conical, ")
}
cat("make Fix/Perm  Master Mix by adding", FPStock, "μL Fix/Perm Concentrate to", (StainVol*MMX)-FPStock, "μL Fix/Perm Diluent.")

cat("\n -Add",StainVol,"μL Fix/Perm Master Mix to each", StainForm)

cat("\n -Add",StainVol,"μL Perm Buffer Master Mix to each", StainForm)

cat("\n -Let incubate for",wait,"minutes at", temp)

cat("\n -Wash with", WashVol, "μL of perm buffer")


```

## IntracellμLar Stain

This chunk uses a function defined earlier, but now surface staining is false. This example is still at room temperature. Just like in surface staining, it only displays the antibodies that are for intracellμLar staining.

```{r IntracellμLar Stain}
stain_mm(stain_panel,T,F)

```
