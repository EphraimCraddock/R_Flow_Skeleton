## Overview

This R package contains basic code and instructions to aid in streamlining flow cytometry analysis. It is consistenly being updated to include more features and better encompass all protocol needs.

Please run all cells subsequently

```{r , include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This package was built in version 4.5.0 You can check your current version by running the cell below. If it’s older than 4.4.0, certain packages (e.g., Rtools) may not work properly.

```{r}
R.version.string
```

Installs and loads packages needed for later. If they are not already installed, removed the \# from infront of the code.

```{r}
#install.packages(c("usethis", "devtools", "roxygen2", "stringr", "dplyr"))
library(devtools)
library(roxygen2)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)

#install.packages("here")
#here::here()
```

```{r}
transpose_df <- function(df) {
  # Extract new column names from the first column (including header)
  new_colnames <- c(names(df)[1], as.character(df[[1]]))
  
  # Remove the first column
  df_no_first <- df[,-1, drop = FALSE]
  
  # Transpose the data frame
  transposed <- as.data.frame(t(df_no_first), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  
  # Assign the new column names
  colnames(transposed) <- new_colnames[-1]  # Exclude header for colnames
  
  # Set old column names as rownames
  rownames(transposed) <- names(df)[-1]
  
  return(transposed)
}

```

##Set Up

### Stain Form

-This section lets the user define the staining format. It sets appropriate wash and stain volumes depending on whether wells or tubes are used.

Set StainForm as either "Well" if using a 96 Well Plate or "FlowTube" if using a flow tube

```{r Set Up(Stain Form)}
StainForm <- 'Flow tube'    #Well or FlowTube

library(stringr)
if(stringr::str_equal(StainForm, "well", ignore_case = T)){
  WashVol <- 200
  StainVol <- 100
  FxPVol <- 200
  Mix <- "Pipette up/down"
}else if(stringr::str_equal(StainForm, "flowtube", ignore_case = T) | stringr::str_equal(StainForm, "flow tube", ignore_case = T)){
  WashVol <- 2000
  StainVol <- 100
  FxPVol <- 1000
  Mix <- "Vortex"
}

cat(
  'Stain format is', StainForm, '\n',
  'Wash Volume is' ,WashVol,'μL \n',
  'Stain Volume is', StainVol,'μL \n',
  'Mixing Technique is', Mix)

```

### Building Stain Panel

Defines a helper function `define_ab()` to calcμLate dilution and record antibody info. You must provide either the dilution or both stock and final concentrations. Have to write function in the form (marker ='', stock = '', final ='')If enough information is available, stock or final is calcμLated for record keeping

These define a functions to build panel. DO NOT change these chunks

```{r stain panel builder helper function}
define_ab <- function(marker, fluor,stock=NA,final=NA,dilute=NA, surface, clone = "--"){
  
  if (!is.na(dilute) && !is.na(final) && !is.na(stock) && round(final/stock,3) != round(dilute, 3)){
    stop("Stock, final, or dilute concentrations may have been calculated incorrectly")
  }
  
  if (is.na(dilute)) {
  if (is.na(final) || is.na(stock)) {
    stop("dilute or stock & final must have a defined value")
  } else {
    dilute <- round(final/stock, 4)}} 
  
  if (!is.na(final) && is.na(stock)) {
  stock <-final/dilute}
  if (!is.na(stock) && is.na(final)) {
  final <-stock*dilute}

  

  return(data.frame(Marker = marker, Fluorophore = fluor, Stock_Conc_mg_mL = stock, Final_Conc_mg_mL = final, Dilution = dilute, Surface_Marker = surface, Clone = clone))
 
}

build_panel <- function(...){
  inputs <- list(...)
  
  return(do.call(rbind,inputs))
}
```

Use this chunk to create the full staining panel by manually entering each antibody using the 'define_ab()' function. An example is provided. Feel free to change the values in the example, add lines for antibodies, and/or copy the code into the empty cell below it.

Unlimited antibody markers are allowed. Each 'define_ab' corresponds to a unique antibody. The function must be in the form of (marker ="", fluor = "", etc.) as shown in the example.

Only dilution or both stock and final concentrations are needed. If you have dilutions and wish to provide stock and final concentrations for record keeping, you may do so. Each concentration shoμLd be in mg/mL. Examples of each are shown below.

```{r}
stain_panel <- build_panel(
  define_ab(marker = "CD4", fluor = 'FITC', stock = 0.2, dilute = .01, surface = T, clone = "--" ),
  define_ab(marker = "IFN-y", fluor = 'PE', dilute = .01, surface = F, clone = "--" ),
  define_ab(marker = "etc", fluor = 'etc', stock = 9.3, final = 1.2, surface =T, clone = "--"),
    define_ab(marker = "etc", fluor = 'etc', dilute = 0.2, final = 1.2, surface =T, clone = "--"),
  define_ab(marker = "etc", fluor = 'etc', stock = 9.3, final = 1.2, dilute = 0.129, surface =T,clone = "--"))

print(stain_panel)
```


This is a commonly used sort panel for convenience.

```{r}
standard_sort_panel <- build_panel(
  define_ab(marker = "CD45.1", fluor = "BV421", stock = 0.2, dilute = .01, surface = TRUE),
  define_ab(marker = "CD45.2", fluor = "APC", stock = 0.2, dilute = .01, surface = TRUE),
  define_ab(marker = "CD44", fluor = "FITC", stock = 0.5, dilute = 0.01, surface = TRUE),
  define_ab(marker = "CD4", fluor = "PE/Cy7", stock = 0.2, dilute = 0.01, surface = TRUE),
  define_ab(marker = "CD73", fluor = "BV605", stock = 0.1, dilute = 0.01, surface = TRUE),
  define_ab(marker = "FR4", fluor = "APC/Fire 750", stock = 0.2, dilute = 0.01, surface = TRUE)
)
print(standard_sort_panel)
```

# Preparing Cells

Perform a count of cells if you have not done so already. The first chunk is just the function to build the sample data frame. The second chunk is where you will input and change data. Examples are given below. The function requires you to input all of your data, with some default options for ease of use. The default option is that a count was performed on every sample, but if a count was only performed on one sample per group due to constraints, this can be denoted with the Single_Count feature, that automatically inputs the first inputted count per group. AN example is shown below. 

```{r}
single_con_count <- NULL #Placeholder global variable so that we can have the single condition count function work across multiple inputs.
single_condition <- NULL #Placeholder global variable so that we can track the condition of the single_con_count

Counts <- function(Name, Condition, Prestain_Counts_ul = NA, total_volume=5000, Single_Count = F){
  
  
  if (Single_Count == T) {
    
    if (!is.na(Prestain_Counts_ul)) {
      single_con_count <<- Prestain_Counts_ul 
      single_condition <<- Condition # Saves variables globally
    } else if (is.na(Prestain_Counts_ul) && is.null(single_con_count)) {
      stop("An initial value must be input for Prestain_Counts_ul")
    }else if(is.na(Prestain_Counts_ul) && !str_equal(Condition, single_condition, ignore_case = T)){stop("An initial value must be input for this condition group's Prestain_Counts_ul")}
    else if (is.na(Prestain_Counts_ul) && !is.null(single_con_count)) {
      Prestain_Counts_ul <- single_con_count  # Use the saved value
    }
  }
  
  return(data.frame(Name = Name, Condition = Condition, PreStain_Counts_ul = Prestain_Counts_ul, Total_10Million_Cells = total_volume*Prestain_Counts_ul/10000000))
}
```

```{r}
sample_info <- build_panel(
  Counts(Name = "MR1 L", Condition = 'MR1', Prestain_Counts_ul = 16182, Single_Count = T),
  Counts(Name = "MR1 R", Condition = 'MR1', Single_Count = T),
  Counts(Name = "MR1 N", Condition = 'MR1', Prestain_Counts_ul =16182), 
  Counts(Name = "MR1 LL", Condition = 'MR1', Prestain_Counts_ul =16182),
  Counts(Name = "IL2 L", Condition = 'IL2', Single_Count = T, Prestain_Counts_ul = 11278),
  Counts(Name = "IL2 R", Condition = 'IL2', Prestain_Counts_ul = 11278 ),
  Counts(Name = "IL2 N", Condition = 'IL2', Prestain_Counts_ul =11278), 
  Counts(Name = "IL2 LR", Condition = 'IL2', Single_Count = T),
  Counts(Name = "DST", Condition = 'DST', Prestain_Counts_ul =22636))
print(sample_info)
```

## Performing an Enrichment
This is optional for if you wish to perform an enrichment step. It takes in the reagent, the number of ul to add of the reagent per 10 million cells and the excess percent of of the reagent you want to add to the Master Mix. There are two functions, one for the count of every sample, and another for when only one sample per condition had a count performed on it. Both will provide a data frame that efficiently provides exact values to add to each sample.

```{r enrich all counts}
enrich_all_counts <- function(reagent, ul_per_10million, excess_percent) {
  add_amounts <- sample_info$Total_10Million_Cells * ul_per_10million
  total <- sum(add_amounts)

  # Named list for the row
  reagent_values <- as.list(add_amounts)
  names(reagent_values) <- sample_info$Name

  # Calculate excess
  if (excess_percent < 1) {
    excess <- (excess_percent + 1) * total
  } else if (excess_percent <= 100) {
    excess <- (1 + (excess_percent / 100)) * total
  } else {
    stop("excess_percent should be a fraction (<1) or percentage (<=100)")
  }

  # Add total and excess
  reagent_values$Total <- total
  reagent_values$Excess <- excess

  # Convert to 1-row data frame
  reagent_row <- as.data.frame(reagent_values)
  rownames(reagent_row) <- reagent

  return(reagent_row)
}


data.frame(t(rbind(enrich_all_counts("buffer",40, 20),
enrich_all_counts("biotin ab",10,.20),
enrich_all_counts("buffer pt2",30,25),
enrich_all_counts("ab microbeads",20,25))))
```

```{r enrich single count}
enrich_single_count <- function( 
reagent, ul_per_10million, excess_percent){

condition_counts <- table(sample_info$Condition)
#This finds the number of unique values within Conditions column
conditions <- unique(sample_info$Condition)
                       
add_amounts <- unique(sample_info$Total_10Million_Cells)*ul_per_10million 

total <- sum(add_amounts*condition_counts)

if (excess_percent<1){
 excess <- (excess_percent+1)*total
 }else if(excess_percent > 1 | excess_percent < 100){
  excess<- (1+(excess_percent/100))*total}

reagent_row <-data.frame(Reagent = reagent)

for (i in seq_along(condition_counts)){
  reagent_row$placeholder <- add_amounts[i]
  names(reagent_row)[i+1]<- conditions[i]
}
reagent_row$Total <- total
reagent_row$Excess <- excess

return(reagent_row)
}


test2 <- build_panel(
enrich_single_count("buffer",40,25),
enrich_single_count("biotin ab",10,.20),
enrich_single_count("buffer pt2",30,25),
enrich_single_count("ab microbeads",20,25))
print(test2)
            
```



## Calculate Optimal Number of Cells to Stain

After you perform the count, spin down all samples and re-suspend at the given volumes. This process does assume you have an excess of cells and aims to provide a concentration of 10M cells/ mL or 1M cells/100μL

The function uses a count volume (μL), which is the volume of cells you have pre-suspension, and the samples given, which is defaulted to the table created earlier. Aliquot 100 μL/ sample into wells when ready.

```{r Count attempt using a function}
StainCalc <- function(count_vol = 50, sample_df = sample_info){
  total_cells <- sample_df$PreStain_Counts * count_vol
  sample_df$Total_Cells_millions = total_cells/1e6 #Count vol is in μL
  sample_df$ml_Vol_Resuspend = total_cells/1e4
  return(sample_df)
}
StainCalc()
```

## Live Dead

This is to calcμLate the Live/Dead staining. It makes a 25% excess to be safe. Specify a dilution, such as 0.001, which is the default if no dilution is provided. Also specify if the incubation is at room tempertaure or not. The function provides a binary option between room temperature and 4 degrees Celsius for the incubation period, with room temperature as the defaμLt if no input is provided.

Make sure all above chunks have been run. Below, one chunk is the function and another contains the function to change in order to get desired outputs.

```{r}
Live_Dead <- function(dilution = .001, RT=T){#Possibly need to calcμLate dilution based on stain rather than vice versa
  inc_time <- 0 
  inc_temp <- ""
  if (RT == T){
   inc_time <- 15
   inc_temp <- "Room Temp"
 }else if(RT==F){
   inc_time <- 60
   inc_temp <- "4 C"
 }
  
MMX <- nrow(cells.data)*1.25 
ld_total <- MMX*StainVol
ld_add <- ld_total*dilution

cat("Make L/D Master Mix by adding", ld_add , "μL L/D to", ld_total-ld_add, "μL 1x PBS.")

if (ld_total < 1500){
  cat("\n Use 1.5 mL eppi.")
}else{
  cat("\n Use 15 mL conical.")
}

cat("\n Add", StainVol,"μL/ml L/D Master Mix to each", StainForm)
cat("\n Incubate at", inc_temp, "for", inc_time, "minutes" )}
```

```{r}
Live_Dead(dilution = 0.001, RT = T)
```

## FC Block

-   Uses FACS buffer as a diluent
-   Incubation time of 20 min
-   Incubation temp of 4C

This aids in making the FC Block Master Mix. Put in the current stock concentration and final concentration. Again, it makes a 25% excess. Use FACS buffer as a diluent to the FC Block. Then, when done, let it incubate at 4 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes.

```{r}
StockConc <- 9.3 #mg/ml
FinalConc <- 0.01 #mg/ml ##929 ml add to mix
MMVol <- MMX*StainVol #In μL
StockAdd <- MMVol*(FinalConc/StockConc)
cat("Make FC Block Master Mix by adding", round(StockAdd, digits=3), "μL FC Block to", round(MMVol-StockAdd, digits = 3), "μL FACS Buffer")
cat("\n Add",StainVol,"μL/ml to each sample")
```

## Function for cell stains

Creates a table to aid in surface staining. It will only display the antibodies that are for surface staining. The first chunk initializes the function and the second chunks runs the function.

```{r Function for Cell Stain}
wait <- 15  #Just asigns these as global variables so they can be modified and then called not in a whole function context
temp <- 0

stain_mm <- function(panel = stain_panel, RT=T,Surface =T){
  total <- MMX*StainVol
  
 if (RT == T){
   wait <<- 15
   temp <<- "Room Temp"
 }else if(RT==F){
   wait <<- 60
   temp <<- "4 C"
 } #Sets incubation time depening on temp. DefaμLt is room temp, otherwise is 4 C
  panel <- filter(panel, Surface_Marker = Surface)
  
  vol_add <- c() # Initialize empty vector to store stain volumes
  vol_false <- c() #Initilaize empty vector to store which rows are false
  if (Surface == T){
  # Loop through rows
  for (i in 1:nrow(panel)){
    if (panel$Surface_Marker[i] == T){
      vol_add <- append(vol_add, panel$Dilution[i]*total )
    }else {
      vol_false <- append(vol_false, i)}}
  
  # Add column to the panel
  panel$Surface_Stain_μL <- vol_add
  panel <- panel[-vol_false,-which(colnames(panel) == "Surface")]
  diluent <- total - sum(vol_add)
  panel <- rbind(panel, c("FACs","N/A", "N/A",diluent))
  }
  
  else if( Surface == F){ #Only IntracellμLar Stains here
  # Loop through rows
  for (i in 1:nrow(panel)){
    if (panel$Surface_Marker[i] == F){
      vol_add <- append(vol_add, panel$Dilution[i]*total)
      vol_false <- append(vol_false, i)
    }else {
      
    }}
  
  # Add column to the panel
  panel <- panel[vol_false, -which(colnames(panel) == "Surface")]
  panel$Intracell_Stain_μL <- vol_add
  diluent <- total - sum(vol_add)
  panel <- rbind(panel, c("Perm Buffer","N/A","N/A", diluent))
  }
  

  
  print(panel)
  
}
  
```

Surface Stains - Incubation time and temp: 1 hr at 4C

```{r}
stain_mm()
```

## Fix/Perm

Once you are finished surface staining, add the Fix/Perm to permealize the cells for intracellular staining. This relies on the input of room temperature or not room temperature in the function above.

```{r}
FPStock <- MMX*StainVol/4
if (MMX*StainVol<1500){
  cat("-In a 1.5 mL eppi, ")
}else{
  cat("-In a 15 mL conical, ")
}
cat("make Fix/Perm  Master Mix by adding", FPStock, "μL Fix/Perm Concentrate to", (StainVol*MMX)-FPStock, "μL Fix/Perm Diluent.")

cat("\n -Add",StainVol,"μL Fix/Perm Master Mix to each", StainForm)

cat("\n -Add",StainVol,"μL Perm Buffer Master Mix to each", StainForm)

cat("\n -Let incubate for",wait,"minutes at", temp)

cat("\n -Wash with", WashVol, "μL of perm buffer")


```

## Intracellular Stain

This chunk uses a function defined earlier, but now surface staining is false. This example is still at room temperature. Just like in surface staining, it only displays the antibodies that are for intracellμLar staining.

```{r IntracellμLar Stain}
stain_mm(stain_panel,RT = T,Surface = F)

```
